T66 Map Assets
==============
Consolidated assets for the procedural landscape tool.

- Grass: from Polytope_Studio (SM_Grass_02, MI_Plants_Grass)
- Landscape, trees, rocks: from Cozy Nature (MI_Landscape, Grass_LayerInfo, SM_Tree1/2/3, MI_Tree1/2/3, SM_Rock1/2/3, MI_Rock1/2/3)

Run once: Window -> T66 Tools -> Setup T66 Map Assets
to copy the source assets here. Then "Generate Procedural Hills Landscape (Dev)" will use these copies.
