# TRIBULATION 66 - BIBLE APPENDIX: STAGES (1-66)

This appendix lists each stage's **Boss**, **Stage Effect**, and **Unique Enemy**.
- **Boss**: movement pattern + projectile pattern.
- **Stage Effect**: positive movement-only (no downside).
- **Unique Enemy**: includes the stage's downside as part of its attacks/behavior.

## Stage 1 - Fire Aries

**Visual Theme**
- Blazing Ram-Cairn

**Enemies**
- Ember Imps
- Charcoal Rams

**Boss**
- Movement: Charge — every few seconds Aries plants its feet, dips its horns, then surges in a straight-line dash across the arena toward your last position; it commits to the lane (no mid-turn), so a side-dash or jump cleanly slips past as it streaks by.
- Projectile: Fire Balls — Aries repeatedly coughs out short volleys of fireballs in a curving fan that spreads outward (like a half-cone), with the fan slightly rotating each volley so the safe gaps “slide” around the arena instead of staying in one place.

**Stage Effect**
- Fire patches (speed boost) — random glowing ember patches pop in and out around the map like Mario Kart boosts; stepping on one gives a brief speed burst.

**Unique Enemy**
- a charred skirmisher with exaggerated shoulder plates; side-steps once, then snaps into a short hook-lunge at your flank. On hit, applies a brief burn that ticks small damage.
## Stage 2 - Lightning Taurus

**Visual Theme**
- Storm-Charged Highlands

**Enemies**
- Static Ranchers
- Thunderhoof Chargers
- Spark Hawks

**Boss**
- Movement: Charge — Taurus squares its shoulders and locks into a long, straight-line bull rush that sweeps across the arena; it commits to the lane, and on arrival it does a short skid-turn that clips a narrow arc behind it, so the safest dodge is a side-dash early or a jump + dash past the shoulder.
- Projectile: Lightning Bolts — Taurus stomps and releases spoke-like bolt lines that shoot outward along the ground in 8 directions, then a beat later a second set fires in-between those spokes (filling the gaps), making you reposition between pulses rather than just tanking one dodge.

**Stage Effect**
- Lightning patches (speed boost) — crackling electric pads randomly spawn around the map; touching one gives a quick speed burst.

**Unique Enemy**
- a static charger with a low stance and broad forearms; builds speed in a straight line, overshoots, then pivots for a second pass. On hit, applies a brief shock tick for small damage.
## Stage 3 - Gust Gemini

**Visual Theme**
- Wind-Split Twin Cliffs

**Enemies**
- Gale Wraiths
- Razor Gulls
- Kite Marauders

**Boss**
- Movement: Charge — Gemini feints with one body, then the real boss snaps into a diagonal dash that cuts across you like a “\” or “/” slash-line; it commits to the path, and a second later it repeats the dash from a slightly offset angle, so you dodge by stepping into the first gap then dashing sideways for the follow-up.
- Projectile: Tornado — Gemini flicks out spinning mini-tornadoes that travel outward in a slow spiral pattern, leaving thin wind-trails for a moment, so the arena fills with rotating lanes you weave through rather than single aimed shots.

**Stage Effect**
- Air pockets (speed boost) — swirling wind pads randomly spawn; stepping on one gives a burst of speed and a short forward shove.

**Unique Enemy**
- a feathered lurker wrapped in loose cloth and straps; shuffles slowly, then bursts with a two-step dash and a sweeping strike. On hit, applies a brief damage-over-time tick.
## Stage 4 - Water Cancer

**Visual Theme**
- Tidepool Catacombs

**Enemies**
- Reef Striders
- Brine Bruisers
- Bubble Jellies

**Boss**
- Movement: Charge — Cancer skitters sideways, then lunges in a low, straight crab-ram that hugs the ground and ends with a short pinch-swipe in a wide arc; you dodge by jumping the lunge line or side-dashing as it commits past you.
- Projectile: Waves — Cancer sends out stacked crescent waves that expand outward in semi-circles, arriving in two quick rows (front row then back row), so you time a dash through the first gap and immediately reposition for the second.

**Stage Effect**
- Water puddles (speed boost) — shimmering puddle pads randomly spawn; stepping on one gives a slick speed burst.

**Unique Enemy**
- a soaked bruiser with a heavy core and glowing seams; stomps forward and triggers a close-range shock-stomp that forces a hop or quick dash. On hit, applies a brief chill tick for small damage.
## Stage 5 - Dark Haired Espada (Ulquiorra Cifer)

**Visual Theme**
- Hollow-Fortress Walkways

**Enemies**
- Masked Hollow Grunts
- Cero Hounds

**Boss**
- Movement: (1) Blink Lunge — he vanishes in a short black flash and reappears slightly off to your left/right, then snaps forward in a needle-straight thrust line; (2) Cross-Step Reap — he slides past you in an X-shaped dash, leaving a delayed cross-line hitbox where he passed, so you must dodge the dash and avoid stepping back into the “X.”
- Projectile: (1) Dark Lances — fires tight spear-like bolts outward in a narrow fan that slowly widens, forcing a last-second side-dash into a gap; (2) Void Ring — releases a hollow circular ring of shots expanding from his position, with one missing “slice” that rotates each cast, so you read the opening and rotate with it.

**Stage Effect**
- Espada pads (speed boost)

**Unique Enemy**
- a smoky skirmisher with exaggerated shoulder plates; side-steps once, then snaps into a short hook-lunge at your flank. On hit, applies a brief damage-over-time tick. Downside: fast boost pads that hurt while active.

**Boss**
- Movement: (1) Pounce — Leo crouches and springs in a high arc toward your last position, landing with a small shock circle; (2) Sun-Circle Rush — it sprints in a tight curve around you like it’s drawing a ring, then snaps inward with a short straight burst, so you either dash outward early or cut inside the curve at the right moment.
- Projectile: (1) Beam Sweep — a bright beam tracks for a brief tell, then sweeps horizontally across the arena in a slow pan; (2) Roar Burst — a roar sends cone-shaped sunbolts outward in a wide wedge that pushes you to pick a side gap fast.

**Boss**
- Movement: (1) Radiant Dash — Virgo draws a thin light line on the ground, then flashes forward in that straight lane and ends with a short back-swipe arc; (2) Prism Step — she hops to a nearby position in a triangular pattern (three quick steps forming a △), with the last step creating a brief light burst where she lands, so you dodge the steps and don’t chase the final landing.
- Projectile: (1) Light Beam — a narrow beam locks for a moment then fires in a straight shot, followed by a quick second beam slightly offset; (2) Blinding Flare — a slow glowing orb drifts out and then pops into a circular flash wave that briefly washes your screen, so you dodge by turning away/creating distance before the pop.

**Stage Effect**
- Light patches (speed boost) — shimmer pads randomly spawn; stepping on one gives a speed burst.

**Unique Enemy**

**Boss**
- Movement: (1) Scale Rush — Libra dashes in a straight line and stops abruptly, then a half-second later the same line “tips” into a side-swipe as if the lane shifts left/right, catching players who dodge too early; (2) Twin-Slash Step — a quick two-step lunge forward with a sword slash on each step, the second slash being a wider arc that punishes backing straight up.
- Projectile: (1) Sword Fans — sends blade-shaped projectiles outward in a wide crescent fan that slightly rotates each cast; (2) Balance Burst — drops two glowing “weights” to either side that then fire opposing straight lines across the arena, creating a temporary “scale bar” you must cross at the right moment.

**Stage Effect**
- Scale patches (speed boost/ slow + no damage) — random scale pads appear; stepping on a bright pad gives a speed burst.

**Unique Enemy**
- a frosted bruiser with a heavy core and glowing seams; stomps forward and triggers a close-range shock-stomp that forces a hop or quick dash. On hit, applies a brief chill tick for small damage. On hit, applies a brief slow effect.

**Boss**
- Movement: (1) Burrow Ambush — Scorpio dives underground leaving a moving dirt ripple, then erupts under your last spot in a small spike circle; (2) Tail Hook Lunge — it snaps forward in a short S-shaped lunge, and the tail whips in a delayed curve behind it, so dodging straight back can still get clipped.
- Projectile: (1) Sting Shot — fires a tight line of fast needles, then a second line slightly offset a beat later; (2) Venom Bloom — spits a slow glob that lands and bursts into a flower-shaped spread of small poison pellets radiating outward, forcing you to read the petal gaps.
